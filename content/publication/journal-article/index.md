abstract: This paper introduces the ant colony algorithm to the path planning of mobile
  robots, and explores the optimal path solution. The definition of path planning
  was studied firstly. Then modelling method of path planning was discussed. Also,
  current research status of three-dimensional path planning at home and abroad he
  existing problems of 3D path planning was analyzed. These basic theoretical knowledge
  have laid the foundation for the research work of this paper, and we then modelled
  the three-dimensional terrain environment, and used MATLAB software for simulation
  experiments to implement the ant colony algorithm to plan the robot’s three-dimensional
  terrain path, and finally performed fuzzy reinforcement learning method based on
  ant colony algorithm to find the optimal path for the mobile robot.
